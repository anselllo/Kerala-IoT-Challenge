# Kerala-IoT-Challenge

> [**Foxlab Makerspace**](https://www.facebook.com/foxlabmakerspace/) in association with [**GTech - Group of Technology Companies**](https://atfg.gtechindia.org/) in Kerala is launching our prestigious program **“Kerala IoT Challenge 2021”**, with a vision to mould 100 IoT experts in Kerala, hosting on the µLearn platform. **Kerala IoT Challenge** is a program designed in 4 levels followed by a hackathon to identify and train quality industry leaders in the IoT domain, while any novice learner can start with layer 1 and others can enter laterally to the desired layer after an evaluation.

> This page is maintained so as to keep the track of my experiments at different levels of the **Kerala IoT Challenge**.

* IoT
* Automation
* Projects 

# Experiment-1 HELLO WORLD LED BLINKING
Iintoduction to Arduino IDE and Its programming is intended here

## Components Required
* Arduino Uno R3 *1
* Bread Board *1
* Jumper Wires(Male to male ) *2
* LED *1
* 220 Ohm resistor *1
* Usb A to B cable *1
 
 ## Circuit Diagram
 
 ## Code
 ```
 
 int ledPin=5;  //defining ledpin as pin 5
void setup() {
   pinMode(5,OUTPUT); //define pin5 as output type: 
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(ledPin,HIGH);//setting pin to on position
  delay(1000); //delay of 1 second
  digitalWrite(ledPin,LOW);//set led to off position
  delay(1000); //wait for a second
  
  

}
 ```
 ## Output
 
 
 
# Experiment-2 Traffic Light

* Arduino board *1
* USB type A to B cable *1
* Red Led*1
* Yellow  LED*1
* Green LED*1
* 220ohm resistor *3
* Breadboard*1
* Breadboard jumper wires* several

## Circuit Diagram

## Code

```
int Green=5;//defining ledpin as pin 5
int Yellow=8;//defining ledpin as pin 8
int Red=6;//defining ledpin as pin 6
void setup() {
   pinMode(5,OUTPUT); //define pin5 as output type: 
   pinMode(8,OUTPUT); //define pin8 as output type:
   pinMode(6,OUTPUT); //define pin6 as output type:
}

void loop() 
{
  digitalWrite(Green,HIGH);//setting Green to On position
  delay(5000); //delay of 5 second
  digitalWrite(Green,LOW);//set led to off position
  delay(1000); //wait for a second
  for(int i=1;i<=3;i++)
     {
      digitalWrite(Yellow,HIGH);//setting Green to On position
      delay(500); //delay of 0.5 second
      digitalWrite(Yellow,LOW);//set led to off position
      delay(500); //wait for 0.5 second
     }    // Blinks Yellow 3 times
      digitalWrite(Red,HIGH);//setting Green to On position
      delay(500); //delay of 5 second
      digitalWrite(Red,LOW);//set led to off position
      delay(500); //wait for 0.5 second
     
}
```
